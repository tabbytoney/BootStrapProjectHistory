            Federal Indian law involves a distinct body of law that relates to
            the legal relationships between the federal government and Indian
            tribes. It is dynamic, evolving and encompasses several hundred
            years of federal policies and interaction with tribes. The sources
            of federal Indian law include principles of international law, the
            United States Constitution, treaties with Indian tribes, federal
            statutes and regulations, executive orders, and judicial opinions.

          <p class="card-text">
            Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is Dee Brown's eloquent, meticulously
            documented account of the systematic destruction of American Indians
            during the second half of the nineteenth century. A national
            bestseller in hardcover for more than a year after its initial
            publication, it has sold almost four million copies and has been
            translated into seventeen languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using council records, autobiographies, and firsthand descriptions,
            Brown introduces readers to great chiefs and warrors of the Dakota,
            Ute, Sioux, Cheyenne, and other tribes, revealing in heartwrenching
            detail the battles, massacres, and broken treaties that methodically
            stripped them of freedom. A forceful narrative still discussed today
            as revelatory and controversial, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee
            permanently altered our understanding of how the American West came
            to be defined.

          <h1 class="card-title">Boarding School Seasons</h1>
          <p class="card-text">
            Boarding School Seasons offers a revealing look at the strong
            emotional history of Indian boarding school experiences in the first
            half of the twentieth century. At the heart of this book are the
            hundreds of letters written by parents, children, and school
            officials at Haskell Institute in Kansas and the Flandreau School in
            South Dakota. These revealing letters show how profoundly entire
            families were affected by their experiences. Children, who often
            attended schools at great distances from their communities, suffered
            from homesickness, and their parents from loneliness. Parents
            worried continually about the emotional and physical health and the
            academic progress of their children. Families clashed repeatedly
            with school officials over rampant illnesses and deplorable living
            conditions and devised strategies to circumvent severely limiting
            visitation rules. Family intimacy was threatened by the school's
            suppression of traditional languages and Native cultural practices.
            Although boarding schools were a threat to family life, profound
            changes occurred in the boarding school experiences as families
            turned to these institutions for relief during the Depression, when
            poverty and the loss of traditional seasonal economics proved a
            greater threat.

          <h1 class="card-title">The Great Father</h1>
          <p class="card-text">
            The Great Father was widely praised when it appeared in two volumes
            in 1984 and was awarded the Ray Allen Billington Prize by the
            Organization of American Historians. This abridged one-volume
            edition follows the structure of the two-volume edition, eliminating
            only the footnotes and some of the detail. It is a comprehensive
            history of the relations between the U.S. government and the
            Indians. Covering the two centuries from the Revolutionary War to
            1980, the book traces the development of American Indian policy and
            the growth of the bureaucracy created to implement that policy.

            American Indian Sovereignty and the US Supreme Court
          </h1>
          <p class="card-text">
            In this book, David Wilkins charts the "fall in our democratic
            faith" through fifteen landmark cases in which the Supreme Court
            significantly curtailed Indian rights. He offers compelling evidence
            that Supreme Court justices selectively used precedents and facts,
            both historical and contemporary, to arrive at decisions that have
            undermined tribal sovereignty, legitimated massive tribal land
            losses, sanctioned the diminishment of Indian religious rights, and
            curtailed other rights as well. These case studies—and their
            implications for all minority groups—make important and troubling
            reading at a time when the Supreme Court is at the vortex of
            political and moral developments that are redefining the nature of
            American government, transforming the relationship between the legal
            and political branches, and altering the very meaning of federalism.

          <p class="card-text">
            American Indian History chronicles the dynamic process of
            interaction among Indian nations, Europeans, and the United States
            during the past five centuries. "Confrontation, Adaptation &
            Assimilation, 1783Present" continues the saga of Indian US
            government relations, beginning after the Revolutionary War, when
            the United States turned on both its former Indian enemies and
            allies. The Policy of Removal forced most Indian peoples to lands
            west of the Mississippi. New policies such as the Dawes Act of 1887
            succeeded in breaking up the communal land holdings of many Indian
            nations. The tragic end of the eras struggles occurred at Wounded
            Knee. US policies such as the relocation of thousands of Indians to
            urban areas and the attempted "termination" of treaty rights and
            reservations eventually forced a choice between assimilation and
            political resistance. Treaty rights and land claims demonstrate how
            the present day continues past history, even as new controversies,
            such as casino gambling on Indian reservations, arise. Because
            Indian America remains diverse, all the issues remain complex.
