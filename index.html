          <p class="lead">
            Federal Indian law involves a distinct body of law that relates to
            the legal relationships between the federal government and Indian
            tribes. It is dynamic, evolving and encompasses several hundred
            years of federal policies and interaction with tribes. The sources
            of federal Indian law include principles of international law, the
            United States Constitution, treaties with Indian tribes, federal
            statutes and regulations, executive orders, and judicial opinions.

                The Indian Reorganization Act in 1934 reversed previous policy.

                legislation explicitly recognized Indian tribes as sovereign
                nations. The act allowed Indian tribes to organize tribal

              Following the American Revolution, increases in the emigrant
              population increased the demand for land resources. Treaties
              forged during this period recognized only limited tribal
              sovereignty. The federal government recognized the rights of
              tribes only to use and occupy land. Increasing land disputes
              between Indians and settlers resulted in the Indian Removal Act.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Indian Removal Act provided President Jackson with federal
              funds necessary to set aside lands west of the Mississippi River
              in exchange for Indian occupied lands in the eastern US. President
              Andrew Jackson conceived of and promoted the concept of an Indian
              reservation as an area of land reserved or set aside for Indian
              use but which remained under federal trust. Federal policymakers
              who supported Jefferson viewed Indian removal as necessary to
              resolve land disputes, accommodate national development and
              continue expansion (Blackhawk, 2006). Indian tribes in the eastern
              US were pressured to sign the land exchange treaties. Those tribes
              who did not voluntarily sign were no longer provided physical
              protection or funding by the federal government.
            </p>
            <p>
              Between 1830 and 1840, approximately 50,000 to 100,000 American
              Indians relocated to lands west of the Mississippi River in a more
              than 2,000-mile long journey known as the Trail of Tears.
              Approximately 25 to 30 percent of those removed died during the
              march or shortly after reaching the Oklahoma territory from
              disease, starvation and exposure (Johansen, 2005).

              While the Indian Removal Act of 1830 introduced the concept of the
              Indian Reservation as a solution to land disputes involving
              American Indians in the eastern U.S., the California Gold Rush and
              the settlement of fertile farmland in the Oregon Territory during
              the 1840s and 1850s led to increased demands for lands in the
              western U.S. to be opened for settlement. Increased American
              expansion into lands west of the Mississippi River precipitated
              the Indian Appropriations Act. The Indian Appropriations Act of
              1851 authorized the U.S. government to set aside additional lands
              for Indian reservations in Oklahoma and farther west in order to
              reduce the growing number of conflicts between settlers and
              Indians.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an effort to resolve increased conflicts in western
              territories, President Grant initiated what became known as the
              Peace Policy. These reservations were designed to restrict Indian
              tribe movement and hunting activities, by military force if
              needed, to specific and often remote areas of the western U.S.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Peace Policy required religious leaders, Quakers in
              particular, to oversee an Indian agency on each reservation and to
              teach the Indian people Christian religion and customs. An
              underlying goal of the Peace Policy was to “civilize” Indians and
              prepare them for US citizenship (Prucha, 1984). Although many
              Indian tribes in the West ignored federal orders to occupy
              reservation lands, the U.S. Army effectively restricted their
              movement. This military initiative resulted in several deadly
              Indian wars. By the late 1870s, President Hayes began to phase out
              the Peace Policy so that by 1882, all religious affiliations on
              reservations were required to transfer their authority directly to
              federal Indian agencies.

              The pressure to open additional lands to non-Indian settlement was
              one of the motivating forces behind the Allotment and Assimilation
              Era of federal Indian policy, which takes its name from the goals
              of the General Allotment Act of 1887. The General Allotment Act
              authorized the federal government to allocate to individual
              Indians reservation land parcels typically ranging in size from 40
              to 160 acres. This policy sought to more fully assimilate Indians
              into non-Indian culture by requiring individuals and families to
              farm their allotments. The policy stipulated a 25-year waiting
              period, or one generation, that prohibited allottees from
              alienating or transferring the title to their allotted land.
              Indians who received land allotments were also granted U.S.
              citizenship.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to land allotment, native children were placed in
              boarding schools (often by force). The boys were taught manual
              labor skills and farming to prepare them to live like white yeoman
              farmers. The girls were instructed in domestic chores, in order to
              make "proper" wives for those yeoman farmers. Their hair was cut
              and their names changed. They were also forbidden to speak their
              native languages. Generational trauma and a loss of native
              languages are still issues tribes face today.

              The Miriam Report (1928) indicated that quality of life on Indian
              reservations was deplorable. Infant mortality rates were three
              times that of Euro-Americans while large numbers were dying from
              measles and tuberculosis. Boarding school students were allocated
              11 cents per day for food rations and provided unsanitary
              conditions. The average life span of Indians at this time was 44
              years. The Miriam Report determined also that American Indians had
              been deprived of their land rights through the General Allotment
              Act. The Indian New Deal allowed communal living.
            </p>
            <p>
              Congress deliberated these results and ultimately terminated the
              allotment process by enacting the Indian Reorganization Act in
              1934, also referred to as the Indian New Deal, because instead of
              “assimilating” Indians to fit into white culture, the legislation
              explicitly recognized Indian tribes as sovereign nations. The
              Indian Reorganization Act allowed Indian tribes to organize tribal
              governments. This policy significantly slowed the loss of Indian
              reservation lands (Rusco, 2000). It restored to Indian tribes the
              authority to manage their reservation holdings communally. It also
              provided for federal assistance to reacquire previously allotted
              lands and to improve quality of life on Indian reservations
              through economic development planning. The legislation called for
              the establishment of a credit system, home rule rights, the right
              to form businesses and provision to improve access to vocational
              and higher education.

              Following World War II, federal Indian policy was influenced
              heavily by “reformists” who viewed the federal trust relationship
              with tribes as the key obstacle to their economic and personal
              success. In 1946, Congress passed the Termination Act to terminate
              the federal trust relationship with American Indian tribes and
              reverse the goals of tribal sovereignty established by the Indian
              Reorganization Act (Philp, 1999). The goals of the Termination Act
              were to: 1) repeal discriminatory laws that granted Indians
              different status from other Americans; 2) disband Bureau of Indian
              Affairs (BIA) and transfer its duties to tribes or local and state
              government; 3) end federal supervision of individual Indians; and,
              4) end federal trust responsibilities for Indian tribes.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the Termination Era, another policy goal emerged to
              accelerate assimilation and absorption of individual Indians into
              white culture. The Relocation Act, enacted in 1956, provided
              economic incentives to encourage American Indians living on
              reservations to relocate to urban areas and seek employment. This
              policy allocated funds to BIA to facilitate a Voluntary Relocation
              Program, which assisted more than 31,000 Indians to relocate from
              reservations to urban areas (Philp, 1985). By 1960, 30 percent of
              American Indians nationwide were relocated from Indian
              reservations to cities, such as Los Angeles, Dallas, Denver and
              Salt Lake City. Proponents of termination thought voluntary
              relocation would better the lives of American Indians living on
              remote reservations, with little to no access to employment or
              education.

              The Self-Determination policy era evolved partly in response to
              the Termination era and partly out of a larger national social
              movement that emerged during the 1960s. A heightened social
              awareness, featuring President Kennedy’s “war on poverty” and a
              growing national Civil Rights movement prompted a major shift in
              Indian policy. Subsequently, in 1975, the federal government
              enacted the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance
              Act. This legislation, which featured two provisions, was designed
              to empower and authorize tribal governments to manage their social
              programs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pursuing additional legislation to fuel self- determination via
              economic development, the U.S. Supreme Court determined in 1987
              that federally recognized tribes, as sovereign political entities,
              were allowed to conduct tax exempt gaming facilities free of state
              regulatory controls. In 1988, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was
              enacted to establish terms for how tribal gaming operations were
              to operate. The legislation enables Indian tribes to utilize
              gaming revenue to: “provide for the general welfare of the Indian
              tribe and its members; to promote tribal economic development; to
              donate to charitable organizations; or help fund tribal agency
              operations.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Revenue from Indian gaming has increased steadily since 1988.
              Recent revenue statistics reported 387 tribal gaming operations
              nationwide operated by approximately 220 federally recognized
              tribes generating billions of dollars of revenues annually. The
              most lucrative Indian casinos tend to be located near or in large
              metropolitan areas, however, rather than rural, remote areas.
              Indian gaming has enabled tribes, well situated geographically, to
              improve their overall quality of life through significant
              improvements in public services and infrastructure on Indian land.
              Indian gaming has also elicited controversy. The availability of
              gambling on reservations has led to addiction behavior in addition
              to related criminal activities on and off reservations (National
              Indian Gaming Commission, 2007). Communities located near Indian
              casinos have expressed the desire to have more input in decisions
              to locate off-reservation gaming facilities. These issues, in
              addition to constant growth in gaming revenues, have attracted the
              attention of state and federal courts and policymakers.

              In the early 1970s, the federal government began recognizing
              self-determination for American Indian nations. As sovereign
              entities, Indian nations have been able to establish policies
              concerning health care, education, religious freedom, law
              enforcement, gaming, and taxation. Yet these gains have not gone
              unchallenged. Starting in the late 1980s, states have tried to
              regulate and profit from casino gambling on Indian lands. Treaty
              rights to hunt, fish, and gather remain hotly contested, and
              traditional religious practices have been denied protection.
              Tribal courts struggle with state and federal courts for
              jurisdiction. David E. Wilkins and K. Tsianina Lomawaima discuss
              how the political rights and sovereign status of Indian nations
              have variously been respected, ignored, terminated, and
              unilaterally modified by federal lawmakers as a result of the
              ambivalent political and legal status of tribes under western law.

              Boarding School Seasons offers a revealing look at the strong
              emotional history of Indian boarding school experiences in the
              first half of the twentieth century. At the heart of this book are
              the hundreds of letters written by parents, children, and school
              officials at Haskell Institute in Kansas and the Flandreau School
              in South Dakota. These revealing letters show how profoundly
              entire families were affected by their experiences. Children, who
              often attended schools at great distances from their communities,
              suffered from homesickness, and their parents from loneliness.
              Parents worried continually about the emotional and physical
              health and the academic progress of their children. Families
              clashed repeatedly with school officials over rampant illnesses
              and deplorable living conditions and devised strategies to
              circumvent severely limiting visitation rules. Family intimacy was
              threatened by the school's suppression of traditional languages
              and Native cultural practices. Although boarding schools were a
              threat to family life, profound changes occurred in the boarding
              school experiences as families turned to these institutions for
              relief during the Depression, when poverty and the loss of
              traditional seasonal economics proved a greater threat. Boarding
              School Seasons provides a multifaceted look at the aspirations and
              struggles of real people. Brenda J. Child is an associate
              professor of American studies at the University of Minnesota.

              Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee is Dee Brown's eloquent,
              meticulously documented account of the systematic destruction of
              American Indians during the second half of the nineteenth century.
              A national bestseller in hardcover for more than a year after its
              initial publication, it has sold almost four million copies and
              has been translated into seventeen languages. Using council
              records, autobiographies, and firsthand descriptions, Brown
              introduces readers to great chiefs and warrors of the Dakota, Ute,
              Sioux, Cheyenne, and other tribes, revealing in heartwrenching
              detail the battles, massacres, and broken treaties that
              methodically stripped them of freedom. A forceful narrative still
              discussed today as revelatory and controversial, Bury My Heart at
              Wounded Knee permanently altered our understanding of how the
              American West came to be defined.
