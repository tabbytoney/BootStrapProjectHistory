            Federal Indian law involves a distinct body of law that relates to
            the legal relationships between the federal government and Indian
            tribes. It is dynamic, evolving and encompasses several hundred
            years of federal policies and interaction with tribes. The sources
            of federal Indian law include principles of international law, the
            United States Constitution, treaties with Indian tribes, federal
            statutes and regulations, executive orders, and judicial opinions.

          <p class="card-text">
            On December 29, 1835, U.S. government officials and about 500
            Cherokee Indians claiming to represent their 16,000-member tribe,
            met at New Echota, Georgia, and signed a treaty. The agreement led
            to the forced removal of Cherokees from their southeastern homelands
            to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Treaty of New Echota gave the Cherokees $5 million and land in
            present-day Oklahoma in exchange for their 7 million acres of
            ancestral land. Though the majority of Cherokees opposed the treaty,
            and Principal Chief John Ross wrote a letter to Congress protesting
            it, the U.S. Senate ratified the document in March 1836.

          <h1 class="card-title">Treaty of August 6, 1846 - Cherokee</h1>
          <p class="card-text">
            By the time most of the Cherokees had settled in Indian Territory
            following the bitter Trail of Tears, factionalism threatened to tear
            their nation into three separate tribes. The “old settlers” had
            lived in the Indian Territory following treaties in the 1810s and
            1820s. These early settlers had their own chief and their capital
            was Tahlonteeskee (near Gore today). The “treaty party” had signed
            the removal treaty in 1835 that ceded lands in Georgia and Tennessee
            in exchange for land among the old settlers. Members of this party
            began the move in the late 1830s. But they were not eagerly embraced
            by the old setters, who had carved out their own life and government
            in Indian Territory. The “Ross party,” led by eastern Chief John
            Ross, resisted removal for several more years and bitterly opposed
            the treaty party and the land exchange they had agreed to. Despite a
            fight in the courts, the Cherokees led by John Ross were eventually
            forced to make the trek to the Indian Territory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through negotiations among the three parties, a compromise treaty
            was secured in 1846. This treaty officially sealed with the United
            States many of the concessions and provisions the various factions
            had already worked out through their Act of Union and new
            Constitution. The 1846 Treaty stated that the lands in Indian
            Territory would belong to the Cherokees as a whole to include the
            “western” and “eastern” bands of the tribe. A general amnesty was to
            be given to forgive the violence that had sometimes erupted from the
            conflicts. Indemnity was granted to the leaders of the treaty party,
            who had been convicted of treason by the Ross party. Laws to protect
            individual rights were to be written and fairly enforced.

          <h1 class="card-title">Treaty with the Cherokee, 1866</h1>
          <p class="card-text">
            On the eve of the Civil War in 1861 the Five Tribes had
            well-established homes and tribal governments in Indian Territory
            (I.T.). These five republics were forced to respond to the crisis in
            the United States when U.S. troops were withdrawn from I.T., leaving
            them vulnerable to the Confederacy. The tribes had little choice but
            to enter into agreements with Albert Pike, representative of the
            Confederate government. The Choctaw and Chickasaw were united in
            their support of the Confederacy, but the other three tribes either
            had an almost equal number of troops fighting on both sides or had
            more on the side of the Union, as was the case of the Cherokee. As
            the United States drew up the Reconstruction Treaties at the
            conclusion of the Civil War, it disregarded the fact that some tribe
            members had supported the Union.
          </p>
          <p>
            Concessions were made by all of the tribes. The first was to abolish
            slavery and give the freedmen tribal rights. The Cherokee, Creek,
            and Seminole treaties gave the freedmen unqualified rights, but the
            Choctaw and Chickasaw treaty gave them the choice of being adopted
            into their nations or being removed by the federal government and
            settled elsewhere. The second compromise was to establish an
            intertribal council. Each tribe would have one representative, with
            an additional representative for each one thousand tribal members.
            The superintendent of Indian affairs would serve as the council's
            chief executive. The third concession was the agreement that all the
            tribes would give up land in their various domains for rights-of-way
            for railroad construction through I.T. The final compromise was that
            each tribe would give up a considerable amount of land as a penalty
            for having supported of Confederacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Five Tribes lost the western half of present Oklahoma. These
            treaties had a tremendous impact on future relations between the
            federal government and the Five Tribes. The influx of whites moving
            into I.T. after the Civil War pressed for statehood during the 1890s
            and early 1900s. However, tribe members fought to retain their
            sovereignty based on the clause in the Reconstruction Treaties that
            stated that no federal legislation could interfere with or annul
            their tribal organization.
